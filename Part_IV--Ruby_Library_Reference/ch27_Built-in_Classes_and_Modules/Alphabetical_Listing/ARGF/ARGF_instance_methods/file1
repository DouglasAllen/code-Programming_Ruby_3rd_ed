ARGF is a stream designed for use in scripts that process files given as
command-line arguments or passed in via STDIN.

The arguments passed to your script are stored in the ARGV Array, one argument
per element. ARGF assumes that any arguments that aren't filenames have been
removed from ARGV. For example:

  $ ruby argf.rb --verbose file1 file2

  ARGV  #=> ["--verbose", "file1", "file2"]
  option = ARGV.shift #=> "--verbose"
  ARGV  #=> ["file1", "file2"]

You can now use ARGF to work with a concatenation of each of these named
files. For instance, ARGF.read will return the contents of file1
followed by the contents of file2.

After a file in ARGV has been read ARGF removes it from the Array. Thus, after
all files have been read ARGV will be empty.

You can manipulate ARGV yourself to control what ARGF operates on. If you
remove a file from ARGV, it is ignored by ARGF; if you add files to ARGV, they
are treated as if they were named on the command line. For example:

  ARGV.replace ["file1"]
  ARGF.readlines # Returns the contents of file1 as an Array
  ARGV           #=> []
  ARGV.replace ["file2", "file3"]
  ARGF.read      # Returns the contents of file2 and file3

If ARGV is empty, ARGF acts as if it contained STDIN, i.e. the data piped to
your script. For example:

  $ echo "glark" | ruby -e 'p ARGF.read'
  "glark\n"

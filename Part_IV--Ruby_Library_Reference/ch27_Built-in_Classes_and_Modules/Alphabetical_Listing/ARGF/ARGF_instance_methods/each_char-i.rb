After the lastcharacter of the first file has been returned, the first character of thesecond file is returned. The ARGF.filename method can be used to determine thename of the file in which the current character appears.If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.ET# ruby ARGF#each_char.rb glark.txtp ARGF.each_char {|chrs| print chrs }
